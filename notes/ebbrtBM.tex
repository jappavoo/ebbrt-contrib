\chapter{Getting Started}

This is what I needed to do to get going with writing and testing
some Ebbs on our bare-metal environment.  The goal is to recreate
some of the "standard" Clustered Object benchmarks.

\section{Environment}
\begin{description}
\item{HOST:} kd-sesa.bu.edu 
\begin{verbatim}
Linux kd-sesa 3.13.0-1-generic #16-Ubuntu SMP 
Tue Jan 7 19:44:06 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
\end{verbatim}
\item{REPO:} 
\begin{verbatim}
git clone --recursive git@github.com:SESA/EbbRT-baremetal.git
\end{verbatim}
\end{description}

To get going once a clone has been done you need to cd into a particular build
directory and run make. eg.
\begin{verbatim}
cd EbbRT-baremetal/
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal$ ls
build  build.mk  ext  misc  sys
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal$ cd build/
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal/build$ ls
debug  opt
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal/build$ cd ..
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal$ ls
build  build.mk  ext  misc  sys
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal$ cd build
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal/build$ ls
debug  opt
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal/build$ cd opt
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal/build/opt$ ls
Makefile
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal/build/opt$ make

  CXX sys/apic.o

\end{verbatim}

To see all the gory details you can run the make system in verbose mode eg.
{\tt make V=1}.

This should leave you with a basic BM bootable ISO image:
\begin{verbatim}
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal/build/opt$ ls 
ebbrt.elf  ebbrt.elf.stripped  ebbrt.iso  ext  Makefile  sys
\end{verbatim}

\newpage
You should be able to run this on kvm via its qemu interface (Note: to run via kvm you will need to be in the kvm group).
\begin{verbatim}
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal/build/opt$ qemu-system-x86_64 \
-m 2G \
-numa node,cpus=0,mem=1G \
-numa node,cpus=1,mem=1G \
-smp sockets=2 \
-cpu host \
-gdb tcp::1235 \
-enable-kvm \
-nographic \
-net nic,model=virtio \
-net vde,sock=/tmp/vde_switch0 \
-cdrom ebbrt.iso
\end{verbatim}

Currently by default this will get you to the point
that the system will be waiting for a dhcp answer which will never come.

At this point you are looking at the output from QEMU on its simulated serial line.  You can escape to the QEMU monitor via "CTRL-A c" or quit directly via "CTRL-A x".  

You can also attach gdb to the qemu debug stub that was configured via the qemu command line parameters.
Eg.
\begin{verbatim}
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal/build/opt$ gdb ebbrt.elf
(gdb) target remote localhost:1235
Remote debugging using localhost:1235
kabort (args#0=...) at ../../sys/debug.hpp:13
13        kprintf(args...);
(gdb) 
\end{verbatim}

\chapter{Hacking}

First order of business is to get a simple baremetal
up that gets all the way to issuing a application
startup message and then sits in the event loop.
To do this must first turn off the networking stuff
and get ourselves up to our own startup code.

\section{Disabling Networking}

Ok it looks like the place to start is {\tt sys/main.cpp:109}
We seem to be unconditionally starting the network. 
There obvious things to do:
\begin{enumerate}
\item passing argument to avoid network startup
\item make conditional on probe of nic being sucessfull
\item refactor code so that startup can be more easily customized
\end{enumerate}
Kludging until I understand more and grok our config strategy.
So for the moment simply added \#ifdef NETWORKING around network bringup.
and tested this seems to get me to an initialized system with out networking
as I desirer.   

Added  to by ebbrt-contrib a qbm script to launch a bm instance with
a set of default configurable arguments. eg:
{\tt NETWORKING="" ebbrt-contrib/script/qbm} is what I am using to test 
my baremetal app with no networking.

\section{Initial "App" Event -- Hello World}

First want to explore how to added an event that occurs after
the "standard" System initialization.  Which I assume ends
at the point of seeing the "System initialization complete" message.

First attempt was adding the following after the first SpawnLocal in main.cpp:
\begin{verbatim}
    event_manager->SpawnLocal([]() {
	kprintf("Hello World!!!\n");
      });
\end{verbatim}

But this interleaved the Hello World before the system initialaztion was complete:
\begin{verbatim}
...
Early Page Allocator NUMA mapping 0x0000000040000000-0x000000007fffdfff -> 1
Hello World!!!
Core 1 online
System initialization complete
\end{verbatim}

Need to understand why.
Next try is to put a spawn at the end of the initialization event.
Ok this seems to have the effect that I want but not sure this is really 
the "right" way to do it.  After I have a better understanding of how to 
think about Events and the Event loop I will document and redo as needed.

I would also like to understand what the correct way is for turning a hardware
interrupt into a invocation of a specific method on a specific instance of an Ebb is (I assume also on a new Event).

\subsection{hello app}
Ok next step is to get Hello World building as its own ISO and runs
on its own App specific initialization event that is spawned at the 
end of the standard initialization event (no consideration for 
multi-core issues at this point)

First approach I am trying is to create a new set of files in the same
directory and modify as little as possible in the current files.

\begin{enumerate}
\item modified main.cpp:
\begin{verbatim}
extern void appmain() __attribute__((weak));
...
    kprintf("System initialization complete\n");

    if (appmain) {
      event_manager->SpawnLocal(appmain);
    } else {
      kprintf("No appmain found...\n");
    }

  });
\end{verbatim}
\item added a hello.cxx
\begin{verbatim}
#include <sys/debug.hpp>

using namespace ebbrt;

void appmain()
{
  kprintf("Hello World!!!\n"); 
}
\end{verbatim}
\item added hello.mk
\begin{verbatim}
include ./Makefile

all: hello.iso

hello.o: hello.cpp

hello.iso: hello.elf.stripped
	$(call quiet, $(mkrescue), MKRESCUE $@)

hello.elf.stripped: hello.elf
	$(call quiet, $(strip), STRIP $@)

app_objects = hello.o

LDFLAGS := -Wl,-n,-z,max-page-size=0x1000 $(optflags)
hello.elf: $(app_objects) $(objects) sys/ebbrt.ld $(runtime_objects)
	$(call quiet, $(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $(app_objects) $(objects) \
		-T $(src)/sys/ebbrt.ld $(runtime_objects), LD $@)

clean::
	-$(RM) $(wildcard $(app_objects) hello.elf)
\end{verbatim}
\item small modification to build.mk...changed clean: to clean:: to allow extension
\end{enumerate}

So now I build this by running {\tt make -f hello.mk}. This produces hello.iso
which contains a defined appmain:
\begin{verbatim}
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal/build/opt$ nm hello.elf | grep appmain
0000000000118000 T _Z7appmainv
\end{verbatim}
However running make allow against the default Makefile creates the standard ebbrt.iso with appmain left as an undefined weak:
\begin{verbatim}
jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT-baremetal/build/opt$ nm ebbrt.elf | grep appmain
                 w _Z7appmainv
\end{verbatim}

Running hello.iso (eg. {\tt NETWORKING="" ~/Work/ebbrt-contrib/scripts/qbm hello.iso}) produces the desired effect:
\begin{verbatim}
...
Core 1 online
System initialization complete
Hello World!!!
\end{verbatim}

and running ebbrt.iso (eg. {\tt NETWORKING="" ~/Work/ebbrt-contrib/scripts/qbm})
produces:
\begin{verbatim}
Core 1 online
System initialization complete
No appmain found...
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Hello App in its own standalone directory}
To lazy to do this one now

\subsection{Hello App with and Ebb}
